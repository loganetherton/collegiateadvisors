<h1>About Collegiate Advisors</h1>

<p>Our founder comes to collegiate advising from the student loan industry. He worked 
for seven years starting two student loan companies, one sold to Lehman Brothers, the other 
traded on NASDAQ: and developing over 100 student loan products. While academic and 
college-related entities attempt to present an unbiased explanation of a successful 
transition into college, inevitably their biases come to the front. Collegiate Advisors 
clients websites, to the best of our knowledge are the only places that parents and students 
can come to when they need a break from "the spin" and deserve to hear the truth about what 
it takes to successfully prepare for and finance college.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the real truth of the cost of a college education is very difficult to 
find. Key Bank research released on April 27, states:</p>

<blockquote>Sixty-nine percent of students who live away from home and sixty-six percent of 
parents are surprised by how much money is eaten up by ancillary expenses like books, utilities, 
groceries, entertainment, cell phones, computer software, transportation and travel... Thirty 
percent of students and twenty-five percent of parents said they had no idea textbooks would 
cost as much as they do.</blockquote>

<p>Thus, Collegiate Advisors, LLC exists to create every advantage for our members and their 
parents, helping them make smart, strategic decisions as they prepare for and finance college. 
We are proud of all the excellent services we offer, but our "company heartbeat" is to make 
college financially possible by: </p>

<ol>

	<li>making sure that the student's career choice aligns with the student's abilities, desires, 
	ethics, and desired financial rewards and is unlikely to change.</li>

	<li>working with parents and students to position them for the optimal financial aid package.</li>
	
</ol>
