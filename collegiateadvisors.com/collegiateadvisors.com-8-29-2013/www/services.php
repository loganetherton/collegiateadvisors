<p>Found within Collegiate Advisors mission statement is the phrase, “to educate as many parents and students as possible about successfully transitioning from secondary to post-secondary education.”  Around that statement, our staff built the most objective and comprehensive package available.</p>

<p>As time progressed, we realized that while what we had developed was a true leader by example, we needed to add more.  A child starts thinking at an early age about what he or she wants to do in life, thus we added the middle school section.  Additionally, the cost of education has a dramatic impact on the parent’s ability to retire; in response we added the retirement section.  Finally, grandparents have been pursuing the thought of investing in their grandchildren, so we built the sections to educate all involved about the tax ramifications.</p>

<p>With schools of all types, public, parochial, Christian, private and the like struggling to make ends meet, we help our clients step up to the plate and help out the schools within which they have clients.</p>

<p>Below is a listing of a few websites out of the many that we have developed.</p>
