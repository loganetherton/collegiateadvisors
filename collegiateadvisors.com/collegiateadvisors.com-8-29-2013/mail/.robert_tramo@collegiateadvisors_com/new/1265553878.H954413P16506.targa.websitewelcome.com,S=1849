Low cloud ceilings forced NASA to scrub Sunday's launch of space shuttle Endeavour to the international space station.

"Next possible launch attempt is Monday at 4:14 a.m. ET," the agency said on its Web site.

The six crew members aboard Endeavour were scheduled to blast off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 4:39 a.m. Sunday.

Cmdr. George Zamka will lead the STS-130 mission. The crew includes pilot Terry Virts, and mission specialists Nicholas Patrick, Robert Behnken, Stephen Robinson and Kathryn Hire, NASA said.

The crew was to deliver a third connecting module, an Italian-built Tranquility node and a seven-windowed cupola to be used as a control room for robotics.

There are only five shuttle launches scheduled before 2011.
