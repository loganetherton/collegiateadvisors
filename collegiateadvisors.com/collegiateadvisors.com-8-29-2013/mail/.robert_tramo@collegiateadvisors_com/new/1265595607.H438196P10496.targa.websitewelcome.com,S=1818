The site is a 620-megawatt gas-fired power plant, according to plant manager Gordon Holk.

The Department of Homeland Security told CNN it was aware of the explosion and was monitoring the situation.

Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell was on her way to the scene Sunday afternoon, her office said, and had spoken with Middletown city officials.

Rell activated the state Emergency Operations Center in Hartford, which was being staffed by the state Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, Department of Public Health, the National Guard and the state police, the governor's office said in a statement. Rell also activated an Urban Search and Rescue Team, according to the statement.

Middlesex Hospital activated its disaster response plan after the explosion, Albert said. As of Sunday afternoon, the hospital was in a "disaster response standby mode," and was not calling in additional staff, he told reporters.
