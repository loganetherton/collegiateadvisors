Certainly, Google Wave and Google Buzz have an awful lot in common. Wave was billed as a reinvention of e-mail, a way for individuals and corporate employees to share ideas, media, and conversation in a more intuitive format than e-mail. Buzz was billed as a similar type of social-media tool that allows for the sharing of ideas and discussion among a network.
 

Lars Rasmussen and Stephanie Hannon are two principal members of the Google Wave team.

Last year the Google Wave team said it planned to bring Google Wave into the Google Apps suite at some point in 2010, but the Google Buzz team has a similar plan in mind for this year, and has the benefit of being borne of the same team that created Gmail, the Google Apps linchpin.

One way in which they are very different is their introduction to the public. Wave emerged more like a ripple than a tsunami, emerging as an invitation-only service for months before opening up to a wider audience in September.

By contrast, Google Buzz was automatically available to any Gmail user upon its launch in February. For better or worse, the Google Buzz team admitted they took a cue from the anemic debut of Wave, which trend-making social-networking fans like Robert Scoble compared to a boat crashing onto a "beach of overhype."

That reception prompted the Buzz team to adopt the auto-follower strategy that accompanied its launch, giving Buzz users a ready-made social network of their most frequently e-mailed Gmail contacts. And for its part, the Wave team just rolled out a feature that lets Wave users get an e-mail when their Wave inbox has been updated, implying that while the Mountain View-based Buzz team and Sydney, Australia-based Wave team aren't necessarily in direct competition, they are certainly eyeing each other's work. 

Rasmussen confirmed that while the projects are separate, Google employees have been using Buzz internally for months, including his team. Asked to explain the difference between the two products, he said Wave is designed around making users more productive in their work lives as a collaboration tool, while Buzz is more about "social sharing and passive sharing with people who are interested in what you think."
