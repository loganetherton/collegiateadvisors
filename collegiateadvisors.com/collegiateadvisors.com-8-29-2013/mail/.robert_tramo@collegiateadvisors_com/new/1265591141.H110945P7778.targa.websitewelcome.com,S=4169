Middletown, Connecticut  -- An explosion at an under-construction power plant rocked central Connecticut Sunday, causing some deaths and at least 13 injuries, officials said. 

Residents up to 20 miles away reported hearing the blast about 11:30 a.m. at the Kleen Power Plant in Middletown, a suburb of Hartford, Connecticut. An area hospital said it received 11 patients, and that two others were flown from the scene to a hospital in Hartford.

Middletown police Sgt. Chuck Jacobucci initially said two people had been killed, but later told CNN he had misinterpreted something heard on a police radio.

Other officials including Middletown Mayor Sebastian Giuliano said there were fatalities, but did not give a number. 

The plant was under construction and had not yet opened, Middletown Officer Kevin White told CNN. It was set to go online later this year, he said, and was in a "testing phase."

About 50 people, most of them construction workers, were working on the site at the time, said Al Santostefano, deputy fire marshal. Workers were apparently purging a natural gas pipeline when the blast occurred, officials said.

"The mayor has been assured that this is an industrial accident," Giuliano said in a statement. There is no public health threat, he said, and terrorism is not suspected.

Middlesex Hospital in Middletown said it had received 11 patients from the explosion, spokesman R. Brian Albert said. Two others were treated for minor injuries and released, and the remaining eight were being evaluated. Hospital spokeswoman Melissa Brady said later Sunday afternoon no more patients were expected.

The patients' injuries included extremity or pelvic fractures, said emergency room physician Dr. Jonathan Bankoff. Some people reported being thrown 30 or 40 feet, he said.

Two people were airlifted to the Hartford hospital from the scene, Albert said. A center was being set up at Middletown's City Hall for family members of plant workers, he said. 

About 100 firefighters were on scene along with state police dogs, and a search-and-recovery effort was under way, said Santostefano. The searchers were dismantling the building piece by piece, he said. He did not know how long the search would take.

People up to 20 miles away reported hearing or feeling the blast.

"It felt like the house was shaking," Peter Moore, who lives about 10 miles away in Durham, told CNN. He said he thought at first there had been a traffic accident on his street or there was a problem with his house. "It was really big," he said.

Moore said his mother, who lives in Woodbridge, about 20 miles away from the plant, also said she heard the explosion, and said it "sounded like someone pounded on the back door a couple of times."

"It was almost like an earthquake," nearby resident Lynn Townsend told CNN affiliate WTNH. She said she heard the explosion and went outside to see "a very big, bright orange flame" between the plant's two smokestacks, and immediately dialed 911.

"It really shook the house," she said. "Everybody was scared. The kids started to cry."

Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance told WTNH his agency has received "an immense amount of inquiries" from residents who heard or felt the explosion.
