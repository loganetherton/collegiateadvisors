<p style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; text-align: center; color: #666; line-height: 14pt;">If you made college less expensive, and kids smarter, <br />
would parents spend some time in your office?</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;">Entities across America are finding the answer to that question to be a resounding "YES!"</p>

<p>Collegiate Advisors is a firm that exists to help you help your clients' 
and prospects' children. </p>

<p>Our automated, online suite of college and now retirement planning tools
makes you an "expert" from the moment you introduce them to Baby Boomer parents;
they make parents appreciate that you did not try to sell them yet another financial 
product; and they make the student a better and more focused candidate for college 
admission.  They make the kid smarter and you, a genius!</p>
