<p>Collegiate Advisors is a firm that exists to help you help your client’s children and prospective client’s children most successfully migrate from secondary, (middle school and high school), education to the post secondary world.</p>

<p>Our automated, online suite of college and retirement planning tools makes you an “expert” from the moment you introduce the products to Baby Boomer parents or the grandparents of these children.  Our services are all private branded, i.e. the services are offered in your company name with your company look and feel.  We do not have a “powered by” emblem; our job is to assist you in your finding the success that you are seeking. Additionally, the services that you will offer will make the student a better and more focused candidate for college admission.</p>

<p>A listing of our clients include financial planners, banking entities, student loan companies, tax preparers, accountants, college planning professionals and schools.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a totally private-branded website - or content for your current website - please consider these three examples of our work:</p>

<p>The application process is quite simple and straight forward.  Prior to applying for membership we recommend that you attend a 1 hour presentation so that you can see an overview of our offerings.  The application consists of you requesting and receiving a simple 2 page application.  Upon receipt, review, and approval, our legal department will customize the contract which we will forward on to you.  Upon your receipt, execution, return, and our acceptance of the contract, you will receive a phone call from our web development team.  While that team is building your customized website our research team is working on developing the data required for your customized presentation. Additionally, our implementation team will forward to you a user id and password for our online library of presentations, documents, videos, and research.  Finally our marketing team will pull the presentation and documents together and send them to you. Within 10 business days we can have our work complete and delivered to you.</p>
