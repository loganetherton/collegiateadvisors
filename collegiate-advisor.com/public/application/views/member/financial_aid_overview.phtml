	<h1>12 Ways to Maximize Financial Aid</h1>
	
	<p>First, a little math: for every $10,000 of financial aid you receive each year, that's $10,000 saved. But remember, you pay the college with dollars that have already been taxed (say, 23% federal, 2.8% state, and 7.65% FICA and Medicare). In other words, $10,000 of aid is equivalent to over $15,000 of earnings.</p>

	<p>Over the family's collegiate timeline for all of the children, this cost can end up being quite high. Therefore, make sure your financial advisor has lots of experience working with the college financial aid system and is willing to help you through each of the 12 steps below. Each one is necessary to maximize your financial aid package.  Ignorance is not bliss, and in this case, it is quite expensive.</p>
	
	<ol>
	
		<li>
			<h6>Learn how the financial aid system works.</h6>
			<p>Our country's financial aid system was designed in the 1960's to provide for better education for our children.  Our nation has changed dramatically over the last 40 years, but the financial aid system has not kept pace.  The result is that today the advice of virtually all financial planners and CPA's reduces, rather than increases, the amount of financial aid a family receives.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h6>Complete your FAFSA and institutional profiles correctly.</h6> 
			<p>Over 65% of FAFSA's are filed with errors on them.  These errors are generally not recognized by parents and students.  Due to the errors on the FAFSA, the aid allocated is incorrect.  Correctly completing the FAFSA and institutional profiles is paramount in determining the correct Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and subsequently the maximum amount of financial aid.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h6>Isolate exposures.</h6> 
			<p>Analyze your financial profile in detail. Identify financial aid pitfalls and apply the necessary strategies to reduce exposures. Also, learn what house value to use. Adjust income, if possible. Review investments for their 1040 exposure. Shift assets out of the child's name. Anticipate red flags in your profile and be prepared with explanations.</p>
		</li>	
		<li>
			<h6>Implement strategies.</h6>
			<p>Here's where you save tens of thousands of dollars over the college education window of your family. Use financial professionals who have strong experience with the financial aid system and a commitment to guide you through steps 4-12. Give yourself plenty of time. Some strategies simply require knowing the correct values to put down on the form. Others require time, thought, and good planning. In an ideal preparation, you should be ready to submit two years of tax returns to college financial aid officers.</p>
		</li>	
		<li>
			<h6>Review the colleges your child is applying to.</h6> 
			<p>What is the quantity and quality of the aid they provide to incoming students? Do they have a modest or large endowment or no endowment at all? Do they meet 100% of need? Are they concerned, flexible, and open to negotiation? Do they have a reputation for buying students, <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL . '/member/gapping'; ?>" onclick="this.href='javascript: void(0)';window.open( '<?php echo SITE_URL . '/member/gapping'; ?>', 'info', 'scrollbars=yes, width=350px, height=350px' )">gapping parents, or baiting and switching?</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h6>Find out what forms need to be filled out at each of the colleges your child selects.</h6> 
			<p>Order these forms. Register for the institutional profile and get the application.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h6>Estimate current year taxes before filling out the various forms:</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>CSS Profile: by mid-October</li>
				<li>FAFSA: by January 1st</li>
				<li>Early decision applications: by November 1st or 15th   (Note: these require last year's 1040's.)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h6>Complete your FAFSA, institutional profiles, and supplemental college forms wisely.</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Start colleges with correct numbers and explain away any "'red flags"' on your forms right from the beginning. It easier to explain up front than to explain later if questioned. You want your application for financial aid to be "'squeaky clean"' and not draw any special attention.</li>
				<li>At the same time, be sure you do draw a financial aid director's attention to any special circumstances.  Remember that while formulas run the financial aid system, each financial aid officer has the right to flexibility. This is called "'professional judgment."'</li>
				<li>Submit these applications at the earliest possible date. Those who file early tend to receive better packages and improve their chances of having 100% of their need met.</li>
				<li>If your exposure is too great in the first year, this can undermine eligibility for financial aid in future years. DO NOT APPLY.  It's a matter of dollars.  How can you save the most money over the entire education window of your family?  If you don't apply in year one, get started right away implementing the necessary strategies to reduce your exposures for later applications. Plan to take advantage of the opportunity for greater aid when your children's years in college and/or graduate school overlap.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h6>Complete tax returns as soon as possible.</h6> 
			<ul>
				<li>Aid packages may change based on completed 1040s.</li>
				<li>FAFSA asks for revised numbers.</li>
				<li>Many private colleges require copies of completed returns and W-2s.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h6>Compare and evaluate financial aid offers from the various colleges.</h6> 
			<p>They tell a lot! Financial aid awards often reflect how eager a college is to enroll your child. The award package could be larger than you are actually eligible for on the basis of need. Or the college could be short-changing you on scholarships, grants, and work-study, all of which are cheaper than loans.  Is this because they don't have much aid to give out (endowment), or because they are building a new stadium? Is the college gapping you and waiting to see what you do next? If you do nothing, they save. If you do call and discuss the award, they are likely to increase your aid and appear to be "'the good guys."'</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h6>Negotiate for more aid.</h6> 
			<p>Sometimes aid is less than expected because of a mistaken assumption on the part of the college. Perhaps it's because of the way you explained - or didn't explain - an exposure. Perhaps it's intentional gapping on their part. Often it's because the forms don't allow financial aid directors enough time or information to be sensitive to your unique situation. Remember, this system has to work accurately and quickly to service many students.  Mistakes are sometimes made, but they can be corrected and even made to work to your advantage. Be aware, however, that almost all parents believe they need more aid. Therefore, your planner should help you develop arguments that prove your case sensibly and logically within the parameters of the system, i.e., using issues that the system values. These are not necessarily arguments that make the most sense emotionally or according to traditional financial thinking. Working with a planner who has experience with this form of negotiation can result in substantial savings in the immediate year and in the years to follow.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h6>Analyze your cash flow.</h6> 
			<p>Now that your child has been accepted at college and you know your financial aid award, how are you going to pay the remaining bills? It may still be more than you feel you can afford. A cash flow analysis will help you find ways to lower household and living expenses and taxes, while perhaps increasing your take-home income and investment return. Of course, you will want to make sure your strategies don't create exposures for next year.</p>
