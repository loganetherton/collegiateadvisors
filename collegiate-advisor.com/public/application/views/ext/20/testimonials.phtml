<p>"Being a parent of twins can be a little challenging, especially when it comes time for them to further their education through the means of college. I was concerned as to how we could financially afford to offer our children's the options of choosing the schools that they were interested in. With Wisconsin College Planning's assistance, specifically Steve Nimmer, our twins were able to select the college of their choice. Also due to Steve's expertise I didn&rsquo;t have a heart attack when I saw the results of the financial aide package. In fact it was quite the opposite. We couldn't have done it without him! Thanks Steve"</p>

<p>"Steve, as I mentioned when I recently stopped in, Thanks for yours and Dan's guidance and recommendations. Having reapplied to St. Norbert College for the spring semester after three semesters at UW-Milwaulkee, my son was accepted but only half the financial aid he originally received. Since he would be paying for a good share of his tuition and college expenses, this became a big issue in his decision making process. He contacted and met with the Director of Financial Aid to see if he could get further consideration. His appeal was successful and they graciously matched his original financial aid offer. As a result he decided to enroll and will be starting at St. Norbert in several weeks. He is looking forward to graduating from there and appreciates your assistance in making it more affordable."</p>

<p>"Just wanted to drop a note to again say 'Thank You' for the advice and guidance regarding the financial aid awards for my children. The letter you assisted us in writing to the Financial Aid Office at the UW resulted in a betterment of the packages offered to both of them. They each were offered a Perkins loan and work study options that weren't there before and the Stafford loans, which were previously offered as 'unsubsidized', are now being offered as 'subsidized' loans."</p>
<p><br />"We greatly appreciate the assistance and advice you have given us over the past few years, and we look forward to working with you for many years to come (remember, next year there will be 3 financial aid packages to worry about!!!)."</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="text"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000;">David has decided to attend Ohio Wesleyan. They have given David guaranteed scholarships and grants in the amount of $25,500 for each of his four years.&nbsp; Additionally, they have targeted additional loan money through their offices that will result in an annual financial aid package of approximately $34,000 each year.&nbsp; The total cost of attending is about $46,000 per year, so we will have to find an additional sum of about $12,000 per year, which should not be hard for us to do.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000;">I really appreciate your help, Steve.&nbsp; You have been very responsive to our requests and you have enabled David to focus at the onset of this process last fall.&nbsp; Through the resources you offered you helped David to take time to truly understand who he is and what type of school would best meet his needs.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s delighted to be attending Ohio Wesleyan University.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s already regularly texting three members of the swim team and making plans for which dorm to live in.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s even taking time to learn more about their study abroad program.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000;">As I expressed in the message below to Lee Harrell, the Assistant Vice President of Admission and Financial Aid, David is ready for college.&nbsp; It was a delight to note that Lee was so impressed with what David has done his senior year that he offered David an additional $1,000 per year in scholarship money!&nbsp; It was a wonderful gesture on his part and it helped impress upon David that Ohio Wesleyan really wanted him to join their ranks.&nbsp; As an added bonus, the school breaks ground next month on a new aquatics center that will enable David to participate as a varsity swimmer his sophomore year in a brand new facility.&nbsp; Surprisingly, that never entered into David&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; He was more interested in the academics, feel for the student population and the breadth of curriculum offerings at the school.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="text"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: ">Austin was really wrestling with his decision for over a month ever since he received the initial offer from Carleton. As you know, he wanted to got to UW-Madison all along. But the acceptance along with a generous financial aid award from Carleton (the best among all college offers he had received) presented an unexpected dilemma and put him on the course of a month long struggle. Although he was always heavily leaning toward UW-Madison, the honor of being accepted by such a highly selective school in Carleton plus their attractive and generous grant offer obviously added to his agonizing debate. Your help in writing a competitive appeal to Carleton and their subsequent revised-offer made the $50,000/year Carleton become more affordable than UW-Madison. Austin's final decision to go to Carleton was attributed to a number of factors: being able to play D3 college tennis, small class size, and affordability, etc. The option of easier transferring from Carleton to UW-Madison (should it not work out) - as opposed to the other way around - also made him feel a little at ease with his decision. Again, thank you very much for all your help and guidance in the whole process.</span></span></p>
