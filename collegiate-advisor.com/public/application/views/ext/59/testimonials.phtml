<p><strong>Kathleen Murphy, Business Owner in Camillus</strong></p>
<p><em>Brian and I can’t thank you enough for the wonderful service you have provided over the past couple of years.  Your professionalism, attention to detail and enthusiastic willingness to always be on-hand made the entire process quite painless.  I can’t even begin to list all the various financial concerns you have continued to help us with.  Thanks to the diligent work you performed on Kaitlin’s behalf, we saved not only a considerable amount of money but much aggravation as well.  We are looking forward to beginning the whole process again for Erin.  I am confident the results will be just as gratifying.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dave Frisina, Disc Jockey in Syracuse</strong></p>
<p><em>Despite already having a son attend a community college, when it came down to another son applying to a four-year college, the more involved financial-aid maze was navigated with the services of Gary Lucas.  He negotiated the process with careful ease and provided the informed assistance and attention-to-detail to tackle and successfully complete all the number-crunching and necessary paperwork.  Highly recommended!</em></p>
<p><strong>Christine Larkin, Child Welfare Professional, Syracuse</strong></p>
<p><em>I wish to thank you for the professionalism and efficiency you showed in completing the financial aid forms for my children.  As you know, I am an experienced professional in the field of Child Welfare buth that in now way translated to competence in completing these forms.  In the last few years I have listened to other friends talk about how worrisome and time consuming it is to complete FAFSA and Profile forms.  They actually take a day off work to do them!!  At my salary, that costs much more than your fees and my time with you has always been under an hour – even for 2 kids.  Plus, I am confident that your forms are accurate and will actually access all the money my children are entitled to.  With me…who knows.  I don’t do my own taxes so why would I risk this?  Thanks again for another less stressful year.  I will see you again next January.  </em></p>
<p><strong>Nanette Slowik, Teacher in Syracuse</strong></p>
<p><em>I highly recommend Gary Lucas for assistance in preparation of forms needed for college as well as advice in financial matters regarding applications and registration.  Mr. Lucas as well as the staff are friendly, knowledgeable and professional.  My questions were dealt with promptly and carefully.  Phone calls and letters were sent to advocate for better situations for my two college age students.  Their services for a very reasonable fee have been gratefully appreciated in a stressful time of seemingly overwhelming paper work.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul J. Herrling, Business Owner in Auburn</strong></p>
<p><em>Since our first meeting – the sophomore year of our son in high school, your services have been very helpful to our family.  The planning, and the filling out of the necessary forms, helped our son to achieve a sound financial package from his chosen College – RIT – was of great help.  Your work helped achieve a financial package that secured more grant money.  This would not have been possible without your expert knowledge.  You made sure that we met the deadlines required by the colleges in a timely fashion.  Your efficient work relieved a great amount of stress from our family during this trying time.  As long as our son is in college, we will continue using your services.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andy &amp; Shari Doherty, North Syracuse</strong></p>
<p><em>We wanted to thank you and your staff for the service you have, and continue, to provide us with regards to our two sons’ college applications and financing options.  Although we considered doing the research, form filing and negotiation ourselves, we quickly realized the benefits of having an expert guide us through the process.  We saved money, time and unnecessary anxiety.  Your professional service in filling out forms, quick responses to questions and suggestions on how to better position our assets allowed us to navigate our way through a process that cn quickly become overwhelming.  We have recommended your company to various friends as well, and I suppose that’s the true indication of our confidence in your abilities.</em></p>
<p><strong>Christina Teel, School Counselor in Austin, TX</strong></p>
<p><em>I want to express my sincere appreciation for the wonderfully helpful service that you provided me concerning the financial possibilities for financial my daughter’s college education.  I have consulted with numerous individuals including a local individual touting himself as a college financial planner, a CPA/CFP, a stockbroker and an attorney who specialized in college planning.  All gave me wither inaccurate or even ludicrous advice that was invariably conflicting on what options were available to me.  I have also read numerous books and attended so many seminars and workshops on college financial planning that the information eventually melted into a blur.  It was not until I came across your website in a last ditch effort, that I discovered what invaluable services you provide.  In addition to helping my daughter to be in an improved position to receive financial aid for her college education, your backing allowed me to be insistent with both an ill-informed stockbroker and CPA/CFP to change my financial direction, despite their objections and greatly improve my general financial situation.  You also provided me with an invaluable education on what possibilities are available for college financial planning, which is very helpful to me as a school counselor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kenny Ta, Business Owner in Solvay</strong></p>
<p><em>Thank you for all of your help getting us more money for Ronald to go to college and filling out all of the paperwork.  We would have spent thousands more dollars each year if it weren’t for your help.  I am recommending you to every parent that I know!</em></p>
<p><strong>David and Linda Pavlas, Marcellus</strong></p>
<p><em>It is my pleasure to recommend the services of Gary Lucas.  His help in the financial aid process greatly alleviated a lot of the pressure involved in the college application process.  His professional assistance allowed my family to concentrate on other aspects of the application process knowing that the financial aid areas was under his control.  Gary fully explained the financial aid process to me and my family so that we could understand the reasoning behind the amount of financial aid we would most likely receive.  With his support my daughters received enough financial aid to attend their top choice universities.  The assistance your family will receive in the financial aid process will be invaluable, both in the financial aid package you will receive and the stress relief it will provide.  I highly recommend Gary Lucas to all families beginning the college application process.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andrew &amp; Michelle Hogan, Auburn</strong></p>
<p><em>We just wanted to take a moment to express our thanks for the assistance you provided our family during our son Michael’s college search and application process.  Your experience helped to significantly reduce the apprehension brought upon by the onset of scores of new terms, acronyms, and specific forms referenced by the colleges we were considering.  The time you and your staff took to ensure we understood the financial aspect of the college search process truly made the entire experience one our entire family will always cherish; moreover, your patience and willingness to quickly respond to our many inquiries went well beyond our expectations.  Now that Michael has completed his first semester as a Mechanical Engineering major at Alfred University (and made the Dean’s List!) it seemed only fitting that we acknowledge your roll in this endeavor.  We truly thank you for all your help over the last year.</em></p>
<p><strong>Susan Tormey, Syracuse</strong></p>
<p><em>We want to thank you very much for your prompt, courteous and most professional handling of our needs.  We look forward to continuing to work with you as our daughter, Colleen, begins her college endeavors.  We would not hesitate, and already have, recommended your name to our friends.</em></p>
<p><strong>Joe and Estella Traver, Syracuse</strong></p>
<p><em>We highly recommend the services that are provided by Gary Lucas and his team of professionals.  We have been a client since our daughter first graduated from West Genesee High School.  In a day when picking the right college and making sure all the necessary financial funds (aid packages, etc.) are available for your child to make the transition from the high school level to the college level there can be a great deal of stress and worry involved in that transition.  With the help and assistance that Gary provides we have found that the stress and worry level can truly be held to a very low minimal level.  It has been a real pleasure to have worked with Gary.  He has always been there to lend a helping had to us.  He has consistently maintained the highest level of the professional help and assistance we had hoped for when we first decided to become a client.  In closing I’d like to thank you for your time in reading our recommendation to you.  But before we end this correspondence I’d like to offer you this one piece of advice for you to consider.  The one determining factor that ultimately helped us make up our mind to seek the services of a professional was this: When you consider all that is involved in the transition process, the time, the paperwork, the different interest rates for loans, the different scholarships available, etc.  All you have to do is miss out on just one of these things and the price you pay for is minimal compared to the price of what it could cost you by not having a professional on your side working for you.  And that’s before you even count for the piece of mind you will get from having them on your side.  We strongly urge you to take this under advisement as you consider wiat is best for not only your piece of mind, but also for your child’s future.</em></p>
