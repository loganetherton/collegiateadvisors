<h1>Single Parent Takes On Too Much Debt</h1>
<h3>College Funding Challenge</h3>
<p>A recently divorced mother was determined to provide the best possible education for her only child. She was already working 60 hours per week, had no savings set aside for college and no educational support from her ex-husband was written into the divorce decree.</p>
<p>When her daughter started her freshman year, Mom had &ldquo;done her homework&rdquo; in terms of filing forms and taking on Parent Plus Loans offered by her daughter&rsquo;s college. She was already $15,000 in debt and was experiencing a $135/month shortfall due to the loan payments. By the time her daughter was a sophomore, Mom was already juggling low-interest credit card balance transfers and realized that she was losing ground fast.</p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>Our analysis revealed an opportunity for Mom to consolidate debt by refinancing her existing home mortgage, eliminate the credit card and student loan debt, and begin contributions to a company-sponsored retirement savings program. Through some repositioning of money in her savings account, we also lowered her out-of-pocket college expenses as calculated by the federal financial aid formula.</p>
<h3>The Result</h3>
<p>Mom can now meet all her daughter&rsquo;s college-related expenses without taking on more debt, and has started to save money for her own retirement.</p>
