<h1>The Trappings of a Dual Income Household</h1>
<h3>College Funding Challenge</h3>
<p>Both parents worked &ndash; one for the county and one for a large corporation. Their combined income exceeded $120,000 and they assumed they would not qualify for any benefits of the financial aid system. Their oldest son was a talented musician who assumed he would have to go to the in-state university that offered a very average curriculum in his desired field of music. His younger sister was a good softball player that had slightly above average grades.</p>
<p>Dad was&nbsp;putting 4% into&nbsp;his 401k to qualify for most of the company match and Mom counted on the pension program from the county for the rest of their retirement.</p>
<h3>Our Solution:</h3>
<p>After completing a thorough personality profile and college search, we identified several attractive private universities with excellent music programs and persuaded the family to expand the number of schools their son would apply to; we also enrolled their daughter in our Student-Athlete RX program designed to market talented young athletes to a variety of Division II and Division III athletic programs.</p>
<h3>The Results</h3>
<p>The oldest son received three financial award offers from private universities; two of those offers reduced the family&rsquo;s out-of-pocket expenses versus the in-state school with the mediocre music programs.</p>
<p>The daughter formed a relationship with five out-of-state softball programs &ndash; renowned for offering athletic scholarships &ndash; that provided strong programs in her desired field of study.</p>
<p>Dad&nbsp;began putting 6% into&nbsp;his 401k so&nbsp;he could capture 100% of the company match. They increased their &ldquo;take home&rdquo; cash flow by $200 per month, were able to send their son to a private university with an outstanding music program, and began setting aside money for their daughter&rsquo;s college education</p>
