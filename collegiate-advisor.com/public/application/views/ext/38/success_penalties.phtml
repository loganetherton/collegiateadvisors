<h1>The Success Penalties of a Professional</h1>
<h3>College Funding Challenge</h3>
<p>A successful dentist had five children to put through school and his oldest was already a junior in high school. Since he had reinvested most of the profits from his practice into state-of-the-art dental equipment and a new building, he and his wife had absolutely no money set aside for college or retirement.</p>
<p>He assumed he would have to pay for college out of current cash flow and loans. He hoped to sell his practice in about twenty years and maintain ownership of the office building, collecting rent from the new dentist that took over his practice.</p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>After analyzing the entire college and retirement funding challenge, we recommended overall debt consolidation (credit cards, car loans, equipment loans and mortgages), shifting income and assets from the parents&rsquo; higher tax bracket to the children&rsquo;s lower tax brackets, putting the younger kids on the payroll and&nbsp;adopting retirement savings plans that resulted in significant income tax deductions.</p>
<p>We directed the oldest child to strong standardized test preparation programs, identified schools where she would be among the top 20% of desirable admissions candidates and provided her with a structured scholarship search program. We also assisted the two middle children in high school class selection, and began funding education savings accounts for the two youngest children.</p>
<h3>The Results</h3>
<p>The family has reduced their college funding liability &ndash; as calculated by the federal and institutional financial aid formulas &ndash; by more than 40%. They have increased their monthly &ldquo;take home&rdquo; cash flow by $600. The parents are projected to have pension income of over $8,000 per month in retirement&hellip;BEFORE selling the dental practice or renting out the office building.</p>
