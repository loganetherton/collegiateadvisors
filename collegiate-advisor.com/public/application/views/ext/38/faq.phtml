<h1>FAQs &nbsp;<br /></h1>
<h3>1. Why should we consider paying for college funding planning?<br /></h3>
<p>Most parents overpay for their children&rsquo;s college education. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Working with a Certified College Planning Specialist can make you aware of planning strategies and techniques that can result in thousands of dollars of savings. As college and retirement cash flow experts, we are trained to integrate education tax credits, income tax deductions, and a wide variety of cost-saving and cash flow friendly methods for funding college and retirement simultaneously.</p>
<p>College has become one of the largest investments most parents will ever make&hellip;your home and your retirement would be the other two big investments you typically fund. Having an expert guide you through the process can result in a substantial savings that can be redirected to your other financial objectives.</p>
<h3>2. What type of family would benefit most from this type of planning?<br /></h3>
<p>Business owners and families that generate more than $100,000 per year in income are the biggest beneficiaries of our services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We cater to families that generally do not qualify for &ldquo;need-based&rdquo; financial aid, but have students that have above-average grades and/or athletic ability, artistic ability, or other unique talents that can be effectively marketed to colleges and universities.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. I already work with a financial advisor&hellip;can&rsquo;t they do this planning for me?&nbsp;<br /></h3>
<p>There are just over 500 Certified College Planning Specialists through out the United States. Just as a CPA is an expert in income tax laws and strategies, a CCPS is an expert in cash flow and financial planning as it relates to funding college and retirement (most parents do not understand how those two things &ndash; college and retirement &ndash; are linked). Our job is to look at your situation, work with your existing advisors, and create a plan that works for you.</p>
<h3>4. We make too much money and won&rsquo;t qualify for financial aid; how could we possibly benefit from this type of planning?<br /></h3>
<p>Even Bill Gates can qualify for some benefits of the financial aid system, but he, too, would have to complete the correct forms. &nbsp;<br /><br />The fact is, applying, being admitted, and paying for college has grown into a complex and often confusing process. The strategies and tactics the schools themselves use to attract and retain the brightest and wealthiest students require that families educate themselves on innovative and creative ways to capture tax-efficient dollars that are available to virtually every household sending their kids to college.</p>
<h3>5. What does it cost?<br /></h3>
<p>Our fees are based on the complexity of your college funding situation but generally range from $1200 to $2400. In addition, we charge a monthly membership fee of $69 for ongoing support, filing, and updates related to the multiple years we will be seeking advantages for your student. Discount programs are structured for families that will be sending several students to college.<br /><br />If we are NOT able to provide you with at least 5X the value of our fee, we will not take you as a client. We are dedicated to being one of the best &ldquo;return on investment&rdquo; services you will ever employ.</p>
