<p>Being in the financial services industry for over 13 years and helping  many families on the Estate and Asset protection side of planning was  very rewarding. Although I met hundreds of young families I started  realizing that college planning was a big need for many of them, and  just meeting the daily responsibilities of everyday life they did not  either save or plan for the high cost of college.  This was one of the  many reasons that to offer college planning services. I believe students  must prepare for college acceptance and academic success. Parents need  to fully understand the financial aid and tuition system, which is  ultimately handled differently at each college or university. Together,  both parents and student need to research to choose the right school and  major. My website gives full and comprehensive tools to achieve the  highest level of success in both lowering the cost of college and  maximizing financial aid.</p>
