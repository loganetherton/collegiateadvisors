<p>As a former Middle School Parent or Student, you've probably given a lot of thought to what happens beyond 8th grade especially in the freshman year of&nbsp;High School.</p>
<p>As a Sophmore&nbsp;Year Student or parent of one, you&nbsp;start thinking a lot more about grades and what lies ahead beyond freshman year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Junior/Senior Year&nbsp;Student or parent of one,&nbsp;you now begin to get much more focused about&nbsp;the critical transition period ahead&nbsp;and begin searching for College Planning information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Realizing that the FAFSA formula uses the time period from January of your student's junior year in high school to December of their senior year to determine that portion of your income that is assessed toward your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), you start thinking about how much financial aid you will get and how you will pay for the difference.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you realize - It's time to&nbsp;start thinking about........<strong>BEYOND 12th</strong>!</p>
