<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Education Success Solutions, Inc. (ESS) provides families throughout America assistance navigating the complex and costly process of sending children to college. ESS offers comprehensive services in Admissions Counseling, financial aid information, school selection, loan analysis, award qualification analysis, ACT/SAT preparation and subject tutoring.  ESS&rsquo; robust suite of college planning services is conveniently offered online and at an attractive price.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The principals. advisors and directors of ESS, have a combined 40+ years of college planning expertise and have now perfected the online delivery of college planning tools that, if purchased separately and offline, would cost thousands of dollars.  The online delivery of these critically important services also prevents parents from having to make even more trips in the car/SUV than they already do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Now, students can sharpen their career focus, identify a course of college study and select appropriate "right fit" colleges from the comfort of their own homes.  Additionally, ESS provides <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the most comprehensive online standardized test tutoring service in America</span>.  Students can get assistance from published authors and editors with their admissions essays; take an online course on managing their money and credit cards while they're at college; get unbiased, "no sales pitch" help deciding on the best college loan; conduct scholarship searches without later being bombarded with solicitations; and more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Parents can take advantage of several financial aid and tax information modules; view an analysis of the pros and cons of alternative funding options; and monitor the tutoring progress of their enrolled children, all online.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The mission of ESS is to help students select, apply to and attend "the right college.&rdquo;<span> </span>The right college is often not the big-name Ivy or near-Ivy. ESS strongly suggests that each family examine the unique personality, talents, goals, values and interests of the student and make a college selection decision from that standpoint. We are proud that many of our client families now have students at schools they had not originally considered in pursuit of careers they had never dreamed possible. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">ESS saves families money in two primary ways</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">:<span> </span>We help families avoid the largest, hidden cost of college and we do so at a membership price dramatically lower than the companies who offer only one or two of the 15+ services we do.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The biggest &ldquo;hidden cost&rdquo; of college is the one most college planners, and the colleges themselves, would prefer not to discuss: <strong>Picking the wrong college and then transferring or dropping out.</strong><span> </span>Nationally, only 1 in 2 students who start at a college graduates from that college. Ever.<span> </span>The second hidden cost - though somewhat less extreme than the first - is significant: Picking a college with a very low graduation rate.<span> </span>If your child attends a college that only graduates, on average, 30% of its students in four years, you and your child may need to pay for six or more years to get that degree.<span> </span>ESS helps each family identify the &ldquo;right&rdquo; college and provides graduation rates for every college in America.</span></p>
