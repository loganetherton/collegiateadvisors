<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The educational mission of&nbsp;IAFG is to help students select, apply to and attend "the right college.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The right college is often not the big-name Ivy or near-Ivy.&nbsp;&nbsp;IAFG strongly suggests that each family examine the unique personality, talents, goals, values and interests of the student and make a college selection decision from that standpoint.&nbsp; We are proud that many of our client families now have students at schools they had not originally considered in pursuit of careers they had never dreamed possible. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">IAFG&nbsp;saves families money in two primary ways</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">:<span> </span>We help families avoid the largest, hidden cost of college and we do so at a membership price dramatically lower than the companies who offer only one or two of the 15+ services we do.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The biggest &ldquo;hidden cost&rdquo; of college is the one most college planners, and the colleges themselves, would prefer not to discuss: <strong>Picking the wrong college and then transferring or dropping out.</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nationally, only 1 of every&nbsp;2 beginning college students&nbsp;will ever graduate from college.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second hidden cost - though somewhat less extreme than the first - is significant: Picking a college with a very low graduation rate.<span>&nbsp; </span>If your child attends a college that only graduates, on average, 30% of its students in four years, you and your child may need to pay for six or more years to get that degree.<span>&nbsp; IAFG</span>&nbsp;helps each family identify the &ldquo;right&rdquo; college and provides graduation rates for every college in America.</span></p>
