<p><strong><em>Andrew Young Collegiate Advisors</em></strong> &ndash; personalized one-on-one Educational Counseling for Students in grades 8-12, We offer a wide array of valuable services to students and their parents, such as online career exploration and personal assessment tools.</p>
<p>We assist your student for all undergraduate years with: board exam test preparation, choosing a major, choosing a college or university, financial aid negotiations, FAFSA / CSS Profile filing, and maximize your financial aid eligibility to get the most grants and scholarships.</p>
<p>We produce a Student Profile Report that clearly explains how all of your income and assets effect how much you are expected to pay for college. We do all of this before your student even sends in an application to a school. Would you like to know exactly how much the colleges and universities are going to cost you before you apply? Would you like to know how to position&nbsp;your assets to keep from spending your retirement dollars?</p>
