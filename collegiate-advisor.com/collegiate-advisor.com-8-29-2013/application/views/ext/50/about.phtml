<p>Jon McCardle</p>
<p>President and Owner of Summit College Planning</p>
<p>Jon has taught over 5,000 families all over central and northern indiana about the college planning process and how they can get their student to college without going broke doing it!&nbsp; Jon has been featured in Carmel Magazine, on THE BUZZ and has been the keynote speaker for varioius High Schools, Churches and even Towns regarding the college planning process.</p>
<p>At Summit we believe that most parent's are under-prepared and rely too heavily on "the system" to help them send their children to college and end up paying too much for their education.&nbsp; The national average of over 5.5yrs for a 4 yr degree and 2 change of majors can be financially devistating for many families to endure!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summit has created a clearly defined path for students and parents to use in developing their proper college plan.&nbsp; We have seen time and time again with students, the college selection criteria be shallow and unrefined which leads to VERY dissapointing results.&nbsp;&nbsp; With Summit we spend a great amount of time, research and energy with our students to properly identify, research and apply to the best schools for that student given their GPA, Class Standing, Major &amp; Career Choices as well as the overall culture of the institutions.</p>
<p>When helping to prepare Mom and Dad for this often overwhelming process, we work together with CPA's to investigate, develope and execute a financial alignment strategy that is efficient and exact in the pursuit of identifying how to pay for any expence that their college years will produce without compromising their other financial goals in doing so!</p>
<p>Paying for college isn't what it used to be and for most families....nearly impossible without proper planning!</p>
