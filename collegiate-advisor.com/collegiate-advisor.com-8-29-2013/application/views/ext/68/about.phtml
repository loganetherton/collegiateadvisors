<p>I am Rick Abend, the founder of My College Planning Coach, Carolina College Funding, the College Planning Success System, and the Seven Steps from High School to College program.</p>
<p>I think I know&nbsp; something about you.&nbsp; You have a high school student who isn't sure about what they want to study in college or where they want to go to college. They are feeling stressed about it.&nbsp; You are having trouble finding someone to guide you through this process and feeling a little overwhelmed about it.&nbsp; You and your student are very busy and really don't have the time to do the proper research. This is a big decision and you don't know where to turn.</p>
<p>I know how you feel because I had two children to get through college and I didn't know what to do. It was a whole new world for me, and I know it is for you too. How do you find the time to do the necessary research and who do you trust to guide you through this complex process? What I discovered is that there really isn't a lot of help for guideing one through the entire process. You can get bits of information from school counselors, some from colleges, maybe some from friends, and there is the internet.</p>
<p>The challenge is putting all the pieces together. I learned that a lot of the information wasn't valid and there is a lot of misinformation on the internet.&nbsp; We did manage to get both boys through college, one took 6 years to graduate and the other five. In today's dollars, that cost us about $150,000 in extra tuition costs and lost wages.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, I was working as a financial planner and realized that many of my clients were experiencing the same things I did when doing college planning.&nbsp; After doing some research, I realized that most families didn't know what to do about the college process and most financial planners didn't know how to help either. They really wanted someone who could guide them through the entire process.</p>
<p>Since that time I have devoted myself to helping hundreds of families get through the college process by developing a complete guide that leads them step by step through the entire process. I did this with one-on-one coaching and even though this was effective, it was difficult to reach many families.&nbsp; Today, we have technology that makes it possible for me to do coaching in a different and more effective way.</p>
<p>This website is a result of much of what we have done.&nbsp; The important tools that are necessary to do effective planning are here and available anytime you need them.&nbsp; And we guide you through the process so you will know what is important and what is not, and what you need to be doing and when. Take a tour from the home page to learn about what is available. Did you know that 60% of college students take 6 years to graduate. 90% of the students we work graduate on time. Just imagine what that saves them.</p>
